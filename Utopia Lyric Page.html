<br>
<br>The situation we are in at this time
<br>Neither a good one, nor is it so unblessed
<br>It can change, it can stay the same
<br>I can say, I can make my claim
<br>Hail, hail, hail
<br>
<br>Yeah, okay
<br>This shit is outta control
<br>I'm drivin' through Hell and I done brought snow
<br>It's shinin' in here and I done brought glow
<br>I hear the sirens right out the chateau, run me the info
<br>Tryna hear what you did, not how you came close
<br>'Cause I get bobblehead like I done made pro
<br>I made Italian bread like I done made dough
<br>I be all around the map
<br>Write a show by myself like I'm Chelsea Handler
<br>Or write a series 'bout my bitches like I'm Kelsey Grammer
<br>Nicknamed the jet Jayhawk 'cause it's outta Kansas
<br>You know it's Spaldin' in my Tonk', I'm in my esperanza
<br>You know it's slammin' wall to wall
<br>We gotta fill the stands up, with slaps and the anthems
<br>Poetic justice, I got you in all my stanzas
<br>With your model stances, you everything I know about it
<br>
<br>Know about it, know about it
<br>Know about it, know about it
<br>Know about it, know about it
<br>Know about it, know about it

<br>What we know
<br>Where you shall go
<br>Power, ah
<br>
<br>Uh, yeah
<br>C-notes, B-notes, I took the biggest boat
<br>We stayed down for life, it's like a jingle to do 'em all
<br>We too much involved to spend a single ounce of time
<br>She bust a whole ounce by doin' lines
<br>I had to leave like the leaves do trees
<br>I'm finally home, I wiped the stress, then I touched that sweat
<br>We took 'em 35 to 1 like this shit roulette
<br>Hold up, beg your pardon, we done lit up, every
<br>Set up, told the preacher, "Never finish," that's to say the least
<br>Buy it, never lease it, but I got at-least a
<br>Mobile, Mona type of pieces, Met Gala, night Jesus
<br>Skip it, hit the city, party pack, I got it with me
<br>I'm shotty while I let you with me
<br>I'm too bent to let you ride, barely 'til it's empty
<br>Gotta feel me, pockets dumb fat and I got a skinny
<br>Squad is with me, and that's everything I know about it
<br>
<br>I know about it, I know about it
<br>I know about it, I know about it
<br>I know about it, I know about it
<br>I know about it, I know about it
<br>I know about it, I know about it
<br>I know about it, I know about it
<br>
<br>Mother Earth is pregnant for the third time
<br>For y'all have knocked her up
<br>I have tasted the maggots in the mind of the universe
<br>I was not offended
<br>For I knew I had to rise above it all
<br>Or drown in my own shit

<br>I was fine with you bein' one of my hoes, for sure (on God)
<br>She say she seen us bein' somebody goals, what are those? (21)
<br>I thought about givin' you the key to my heart, but it's froze
<br>
<br>Where would you go now?
<br>Now that you're done with me
<br>Where would you go now?
<br>Now that you're done with me
<br>Where would you go now?

<br>(Ooh) if energy makes energy
<br>X-rated love, X-rated love
<br>If energy makes energy, makes energy
<br>X-rated love, X-rated love
<br>
<br>You know the love was X-rated, it's how we made it
<br>Drinkin' help balance the patience, watch how you take it
<br>Can't keep no pictures, it's too dangerous, a bit X-rated
<br>Took everything up for the takin', I couldn't save it
<br>See red and blues, I hit the pavement, got love, got vacant
<br>She needed angles, I need angels, I'm fightin' Satan
<br>Leave me faded, I feel painless, I go out gracious
<br>I'm tryna feel a shade of greatness by celebratin'
<br>Bring entertainment, goin' brainless, like goin' dumb on my hiatus
<br>She fall more in love every time that I tip
<br>I fade away every time that I-
<br>Take a sip, I been goin' off the rip
<br>I been bumpin' more Coldplay, the world cold as shit
<br>I know one thing 'bout the old one, can't have more fun with it
<br>Knew exactly how to roll one and how to tote a stick
<br>Even if she had to show some' she never let him hit
<br>Always knew she always on one and I can bear with it
<br>Yeah, I can bear with it
<br>
<br>Where will you go now?
<br>Now that you're done with me
<br>Where will you go now?
<br>Now that you're done with me
<br>Where will you go now?
<br>Now that you're done with me
<br>Where will you go now?
<br>Now that you're done with me
