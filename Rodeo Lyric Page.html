<br><h2><b>Pornography</b></h2>
<br>
<br>Nine light years away, just outside of the Kepler solar system
<br>We find ourself consumed and utterly mesmerized
<br>With a story of a young rebel against the system
<br>Refusing to conform or comply to the ways of authority
<br>He chose the mood of "fuck this shit"
<br>At that moment, the one known as Jacques turned to Scott
<br>Chose to jump off his mama porch leading the stampede of lost souls
<br>In the middle of their metamorphosis, not quite through with their journey
<br>Ain't made it through whatever the fuck they gon' be in life
<br>But wherever it is, it's better than here
<br>So fuck you and fuck this
<br>
<br>No monogamy, ménage with me
<br>Pornography surrounding me
<br>You get high with me, you come down with me
<br>That's all I need in my fantasy
<br>All these flashing lights
<br>Give you some of me, you want all of me
<br>And get high with me, and come down with me
<br>Yeah that's all I need in my fantasy
<br>
<br>You remind me of my ex, crazy love
<br>We designed our love around the drugs
<br>We both in this club, we both tryna fuck
<br>I'ma rub a dub, tryna get a nut
<br>
<br>No monogamy, ménage with me
<br>Pornography surrounding me
<br>You get high with me, you come down with me
<br>That's all I need in my fantasy
<br>All these flashing lights blinding me
<br>Give you some of me, you want all of me
<br>And get high with me, and come down with me
<br>That's all I need in my fantasy
<br>
<br>The story of the bastard was never told
<br>The soul of a bastard was never sold
<br>Will he survive, or will he fold up?
<br>Living like a bronco, lifestyle wild and untamed
<br>Sit sip at the top, a long list of no named
<br>Misfits can't wait to get a chance to say fuck you
<br>To the ones that say fuck you
<br>'Til you doing yo' thing, Codeine and Cocaine cartels
<br>Who leads the charge of this young mob?
<br>La flame he is in his head, the world is yours
<br>
<br>Wake up N****, gotta get the cake up, N****
<br>N***** in the bushes in the farms
<br>Might gotta got to rake up a N****
<br>I'm way too antsy, 'cause my ambition's too frantic
<br>I might need to move to Atlantis, 'cause my mind's too outlandish
<br>
<br>It's the rodeo, time to get started
<br>Houston N****, goin' James Harden
<br>They was wildin' on us N***** in the projects
<br>Wonder why a N**** went cold hearted
<br>They wanna put my soul up on an auction
<br>But I'ma make 'em take the fall like August
<br>And they gon' vote me right in on my caucus
<br>And I'ma show these N***** how to get lawless
<br>Why your hands out, asking could you hold one
<br>Who do I owe? N****, no one
<br>They bigging you up but you low down
<br>Animated acting frozen
<br>I got porno pics, wish I can post 'em
<br>Stackin' Franklins, I can't fold 'em
<br>N***** askin' for the old him
<br>But I'm way too young to be the old him
<br>I'ma make this shit crack, Lamar Odom
<br>'Til I climb to the top of the podium
<br>
<br>So wake up N****, gotta get the cake up, N****
<br>N***** in the bushes, N***** on the farm
<br>Might gotta rake up a N****
<br>I'm way too antsy, 'cause my ambition's too frantic
<br>I might move out to Atlantis, 'cause my mind's too outlandish
<br>We gon' rule the world, we gon' rule the world
<br>We gon' rule the world

<br>That sponsors the revolution that will not be televised
<br>Decide to cross those lil' guys, you've obviously been ill-advised
<br>Yet and still, the question that arises to the mind
<br>Will he make it? Was it worth it?
<br>Did he win? Will he survive? The Rodeo
