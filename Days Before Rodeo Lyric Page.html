<br><b>Days Before Rodeo: The Prayer</b>
<br>
<br>Midnight awakin', hyperventilatin'
<br>Drunk laps runnin' 'round the globe wild goose chasin'
<br>After three number one albums would've thought I'd feel amazin'
<br>Still impatient, still sippin' on liquor
<br>Still rollin' up swishers
<br>Now it's Beamers double parking, fuck payin' the meter
<br>In your club, on your couch, just got paid to be here
<br>On your girl, rubbin' on my favorite features
<br>How could they tease us, only wanted of Ben Franklins and Mona Lisas
<br>
<br>Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
<br>Man, I might fuck 'round, lose my mind, I gotta break out
<br>I'm on a stake out, on a farm or your lake house
<br>
<br>Around 3 AM dog
<br>I was gettin' busy in the bathroom stall
<br>Bad mamacita, Miami heater
<br>Put it in a two seater, too bad I couldn't three-peat her
<br>Need a whole lotta vida 'fore I see the reaper
<br>House full of snow bunnies, puttin' trees up like it's Christmas Easter
<br>With more stamps than a skinny N**** got tats on my Visa
<br>I know the kids in La Flame, they don't trust, they believe it
<br>
<br>I mean, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
<br>Man, I might fuck 'round, lose my mind, I gotta break out
<br>I'm on a stake out, on a farm or your lake house
<br>
<br>Jesus, Jesus, I mean, Jesus, Jesus
<br>Man, I might fuck 'round, lose my mind, I gotta break out
<br>I'm on a stake out, on a farm or your lake house
