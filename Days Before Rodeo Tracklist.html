        <!-- I definetly had trouble with fully understanding CSS and it took a lot of trial and error until i was able to come up with a solution.-->
            <!-- There were also alot of alignment issues that took time, i had to get my friends ryan's help to trouble shoot as to why the information box would go above the track list instead of next to it. I also had some problems with forgetting to close some tags which would mess up the format.-->

<!-- To make the tracklist background more interesting, i had to add a background pattern which gave me some trouble because i did not know how to repeat the pattern, and the background-repeat was really confusing to me. It took various youtube videos and asking my Friend Gianluca who eventually was able to explain it to me and make it easier. My reasoning for going with a flame pattern is that of of Travis Scott's Nicknames is "La Flame", so i felt that it was fitting to put that pattern behind his tracklists.-->

            <h2>About 
                <br>"Days Before Rodeo"</h2>
            <p>Travis Scott's mixtape "Days Before Rodeo," released in 2014, serves as a pivotal moment in the artist's ascent to hip-hop stardom. This project, while technically a mixtape, showcases Scott's knack for crafting immersive sonic experiences and pushing the boundaries of conventional rap. "Days Before Rodeo" acts as a prelude to his debut studio album "Rodeo," offering listeners a tantalizing glimpse into the artist's sonic palette and thematic preoccupations. The mixtape's title suggests a sense of anticipation and foreboding, setting the stage for the wild ride that awaits.

            While "Days Before Rodeo" primarily showcases Travis Scott's solo artistry, it also features several notable guest appearances that add depth and diversity to the project. Among the standout collaborations are appearances by Big Sean on the electrifying "Don't Play" and Young Thug on the hypnotic "Skyfall." These features complement Scott's dynamic energy and visionary production, elevating the mixtape to new heights.
